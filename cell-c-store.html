                    <h2><strong></strong>CELL C</strong></h2>
                    <P>Cell C's range of products and services is supported by its network which offers 2G, 3G and LTE services and covers 98% of South Africa's population; the company has a roaming agreement in place with Vodacom to provide 2G and 3G services to customers in outlying areas. In 2015, Cell C announced an investment of approximately R8 billion to roll out LTE across the country.</P>
                    <P>The Cell C network operates on three key bands: 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2100 MHz.</P>
                    <P>Cell C has almost tripled its customer base since 2012, acting as a disruptor and pushing for regulatory changes such as lower and asymmetrical mobile termination rates. A study commissioned by the South African National Treasury and conducted by the University of Johannesburg's Centre for Competition, Regulation and Economic Development found that the lower termination rates introduced in 2011 has saved South African consumers R47 billion over five years.</P>
